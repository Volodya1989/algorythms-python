# Algorithms in Python

Welcome to the **algorythms-python** repository! This project is a growing collection of classic and modern algorithm implementations written in clean, idiomatic Python. It is designed to support learning, interview preparation, and general reference for developers and students.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository includes various algorithms grouped by topics, such as:

- 📌 **Sorting** – Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- 🔍 **Searching** – Binary Search, Linear Search
- ➗ **Mathematics** – Fibonacci, GCD, LCM, Primality checks
- 📚 **Recursion** – Factorial, Tower of Hanoi
- 💡 **Logic problems** – Common coding interview challenges
- 🔄 **Iterative vs Recursive** implementations
- 🧪 **Testing & Debugging** (if applicable)

Each script is typically self-contained, with function definitions and often basic input/output examples.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Volodya1989/algorythms-python.git
   cd algorythms-python
   ```

2. **Run a script**
   ```bash
   python3 sorting/bubble_sort.py
   ```

3. **Explore and experiment** – Feel free to tweak, add tests, or time performance.
